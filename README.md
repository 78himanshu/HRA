## Brief Description of Human Activity Recognition (HAR)

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) involves identifying and classifying physical activities, such as walking, standing, and sitting, using sensor data collected from devices like smartphones and wearables. It has applications in fitness tracking, health monitoring, rehabilitation, and eldercare. HAR models typically utilize accelerometer and gyroscope data to recognize activity patterns.
